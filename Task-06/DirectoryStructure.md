## Explanation of Files and Folders:

1. ```PagePal_bot.py```:
This is the main Python file of the project. It contains the code that interacts with the Telegram Bot API and the Google Books API to fetch and display book recommendations based on genre.

2. ```.env```:
The .env file contains important credentials like the Google Books API key and Telegram Bot Token. This file is kept out of vision for security reasons.
