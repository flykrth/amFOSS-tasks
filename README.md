# Praveshan2024

## Who am I?
A small introduction about myself, my name is Karthik Krishna and I belong to CSE (AI) department. Have a passion for coding and aviation most likely to be accompanied by my habit of perpectual music listening.

## Why should we choose you?
Fortunately, as a technology enthusiast, I am particularly interested in Open Source development and programming software. I have a strong command of Python, JavaScript, Java, and C. Joining a group like amFOSS to develop my skills by learning from more knowledgeable individuals while also contributing to active projects is my intention. For me, joining amFOSS shall just be the right way of advancing myself and doing charity work at the same time. 

## How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
I'm excited to contribute to ongoing projects, work on group projects, and help colleagues who are facing difficulties. I plan to participate actively in the club's open-source initiatives by helping to maintain the codebase and reviewing and contributing to the authoring of code. Additionally, I'd like to establish new initiatives that support the club's objectives. As the club continues to grow, I hope to step up into a mentoring role, most likely assisting more recent members with their first projects and pushing them to be creative and innovative on their own. I'm excited to take part in club activities like workshops and hackathons. I would be qualified to plan and direct such activities as well.

## What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?
My fields of interest include open-source projects and broad field of Artificial Intelligence. I am working on small projects to contribute to the Linux community in that case. And also willing to learn more ways to under AI better.
