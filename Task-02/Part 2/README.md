# Code: LnnmknnlLhrsdhk

## Commands used:
- git checkout
- git switch
- grep -i
- tree

Here, firstly I switched into The-Light-Realm branch using the 'git switch' command, which was confirmed later by 'git checkout'. After changing the directory into Arrakis-Dex using 'cd', I used 'grep -i "holy" .' to find the files containing the word "holy" in them and then consquently used the same command for "good" to filter down even further to exactly find which file has both the words in it together. Thus finding the 2 files, "Moonbloom" and "Mistveil". And then by changing the letters with the ones presiding them in alphabetical order, i got the holy spell. Then used 'tree' command to find the Celestial Veil Amulet. Killed Khanrock and got the code inside there.
